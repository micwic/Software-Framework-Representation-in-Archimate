Spring Web is a core module of the Spring Framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure for building web applications. It enables the development of HTTP-based web applications, offering support for RESTful web services and MVC architecture. &#xD;
Spring Web simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses, form handling, and session management.&#xD;
In Spring Web, annotations are used to simplify the development of web applications by providing declarative mappings between HTTP requests and controller methods. Key annotations include @Controller to define a web controller, @RequestMapping to map HTTP requests to handler methods, and @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc., for specific HTTP methods. Annotations like @RestController are used for building RESTful web services, combining @Controller and @ResponseBody to handle web requests and directly return data as JSON or XML. &#xD;
These annotations streamline the configuration and handling of web endpoints in Spring applications.</documentation>

&#xD;
This artefact represents the deployable and executable application, designed according to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It includes three layers:&#xD;
&#xD;
Application Layer: Responsible for coordinating tasks and interactions between the domain and external interfaces. It contains the logic that manages the application flow, but does not contain business rules itself. It defines how the domain model interacts with external systems, such as user interfaces or other applications, ensuring the correct use of the domain logic.&#xD;
&#xD;
Domain Layer: This layer encapsulates the domain model, which consists of entities, value objects, aggregates, and repositories. The domain layer handles the core business rules and represents the business logic that is independent of technical concerns. It is the central part of the application responsible for enforcing business invariants and performing business operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Additionally, this artefact covers the Interface Layer, which manages the integration with frameworks and technological services (such as Spring Boot, Spring Quartz, and other supporting libraries). It provides the interfaces and adapters to communicate with external services, while leveraging the framework functionalities to offer technological capabilities like scheduling, persistence, and transaction management.</documentation>

      <documentation>Hard-coded use of framework library features through annotations.&#xD;
This artefact highlights the integration of the framework's features directly into the domain/application layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Example of annoted method to configure the use of a framework library : A Sping Boot application with some scheduling task configured and launched by using Spring Quartz, Quartz.&#xD;
Annotations in Spring Boot with Spring Quartz are a powerful mechanism for simplifying the configuration and scheduling of tasks within the application’s domain logic (business layer). Annotations such as @Scheduled and @EnableScheduling allow developers to declare scheduled tasks directly in the source code, without the need for extensive XML or property-based configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
@EnableScheduling: This annotation is placed on a configuration class to enable Spring’s scheduling capabilities within the application context.&#xD;
@Scheduled: Used at the method level, this annotation allows the specification of task execution schedules (e.g., fixed intervals, cron expressions), defining when specific business logic should be triggered automatically.&#xD;
These annotations form part of the source code artefact representing the business logic in the domain or application layer and are tightly integrated with the Spring Quartz framework. They provide an abstraction layer that simplifies task scheduling by allowing Quartz jobs and triggers to be declared directly in the code, making the scheduling behavior more maintainable and transparent.</documentation>

Framework Example : Spring Quartz, Quartz&#xD;
Spring Quartz is a module that integrates the Quartz job scheduling framework with the Spring Boot ecosystem. It simplifies the configuration and management of Quartz jobs by leveraging Spring’s dependency injection and annotation-driven approach. With Spring Quartz, developers can easily define and manage scheduled tasks using annotations like @Scheduled and @EnableScheduling, while benefiting from Spring's flexible transaction management and ease of configuration. It also allows for advanced scheduling use cases, such as dynamic job creation and persistence of job details in a database. In this ArchiMate model, Spring Quartz is represented as an artefact that facilitates the interaction between the business logic (application layer) and the underlying Quartz scheduling framework (technology layer).</documentation>

      <documentation>Example : Quartz&#xD;
Quartz is a robust, open-source job scheduling library designed for Java applications. It provides the ability to schedule jobs (tasks) to be executed at specific times or intervals. Integrated with Spring Boot through Spring Quartz, Quartz allows developers to manage both simple and complex schedules using cron expressions, fixed intervals, or custom triggers. It supports persistent storage of job data in databases and enables the concurrent execution of jobs. In this ArchiMate model, the Quartz library is represented as an artefact, reflecting its role in providing the technical infrastructure for the scheduling of tasks within the application.&#xD;

      <documentation>### 1. **Intent**&#xD;
The primary goal of this modeling is to test ArchiMate as a standard for documenting a system in the context of a pre-project opportunity study or as reference documentation during or after project execution, including the deployment. &#xD;
The model has been designed as a multi-layer representation to identify the most relevant layers for documenting complex systems. &#xD;
This exercise aims to validate ArchiMate’s flexibility and rigor in supporting a comprehensive, standardized technical documentation process.&#xD;
While this approach intentionally goes beyond the initial scope of ArchiMate, it demonstrates the potential to extend the standard's use to cover the entire lifecycle of a solution, from design through implementation, deployment, and operations. By doing so, it maintains strong connections with the original vision and intent that underpin the change project, ensuring continuity between the strategic objectives and the technical execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
### 2. **General Overview**&#xD;
This ArchiMate model is based on a representative case designed to illustrate the final state of the system, which serves as the reference documentation. It does not include the various phases of the project due to time constraints but focuses on delivering a consolidated view of the architecture once the project is completed. The model highlights the most pertinent architectural layers to be used as reference documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The issue that prompted the intention to carry out this modeling is the difficulty in clearly positioning the integration of standard market frameworks within business applications between the application and technology layers.&#xD;
The initial models placed the use of these frameworks in the technology layer. However, this led to inconsistencies when functionalities or data objects were directly used by application functions. It also became apparent that these uses pertained to software architecture during the build phase of the solution, whereas the key elements of the technology layer were more aligned with system architecture during deployment and operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
The imagined case is deliberately simple in terms of the business requirements to be met. It involves the automatic execution of an application process/function from a scheduler integrated into an application. The application function extracts data from Process Mining and conducts an analysis to derive relevant indicators. The user can access these indicators in dashboards and lists to facilitate a process review session. It is driven by a single Business Requirement to illustrate the possible links with the motivations that led to this intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
The main subject of the modeling is to position the use of standard frameworks in the design and realization of business applications. This is why the application is a Spring Boot application that integrates Spring Quartz to provide scheduling functionality.&#xD;
This is made visible by the implementation of a principle of compliance with norms and standards in the model. The adoption of the principle is expected to reach a level of maturity of capability. It is explicitly shown in the model (and is more even important in the EA repository).&#xD;
&#xD;
Each element in the model has been individually documented, providing a detailed understanding of the components and their relationships within the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
### 3. **Findings**&#xD;
&#xD;
Standard frameworks integrated into business applications are clearly and definitively an integral part of the business application. Their functionality is directly associated with business concepts. It is sometimes/often useful, depending on the context, to represent them to understand the business logic. Standard frameworks are well documented&#xD;
&#xD;
Standard frameworks are most often well-documented, so it is essential to refer to this documentation rather than reproduce it. It may be beneficial to enrich it with what is specific to the context, but only for the elements that are useful to represent in the models, such as functionalities related to specific business concepts they implement.&#xD;
&#xD;
Just like business logic - which is also an integral part of business applications - their deployment and execution rely on elements from the technology layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
To the question of whether ArchiMate is an effective notation standard for the development of pre-studies, the design phase, and later as support for reference documentation of a business application, the answer is definitely yes.&#xD;
The modeling of the representative case demonstrated that : &#xD;
- an architecture following BDD/DDD principles was feasible and represented in a meaningful way (software design by business analyst(input), software designer/developer, technology leader).&#xD;
- the integration of functionalities offered by standard frameworks was feasible and represented in a meaningful way (software architecture by software architect, technology leader).&#xD;
- the representation of artifacts, configurations, and infrastructure resources from the technology layer could be linked to relevant elements in the application layer to ensure deployment, integration, and operation process definition by system architects.&#xD;
&#xD;
ArchiMate goes further by also making explicit the principles of good practices such as DDD or BDD. The models created during the design phase will clearly show any potential deviations or violations of domain segregation, for example. &#xD;
That said, the models should not be redundant with the code and its documentation. The models should be limited to the overall design and refer to the living documentation produced from the code for implementation details in the software. The same applies to behaviors and data.&#xD;
The principles of BDD and DDD have been chosen because they are intended to be representative of business architecture. They align with what ArchiMate recommends for modeling application behaviors. Software constructions based on other principles will require interrelations between the behavioral aspects, which remain the rule in ArchiMate, and the implementation according to the software architecture. These interrelations should be handle on a documentary level; they do not need to be modeled in ArchiMate.&#xD;
&#xD;
The representation of the software and application architecture in a model reveals a considerable number of elements and relationships. So much so that only an automated and dynamic representation sourced from the repository makes sense, except for limited use cases where it is necessary to express a specific problem within a defined scope.&#xD;
&#xD;
### 4. **Conclusion**&#xD;
&#xD;
The use of frameworks at the application level was not anticipated during the development of the Archimate standard. They are often considered part of the technology layer. While this is appropriate for virtualization, application containers, and other facilities, it is not relevant for application frameworks like Spring Boot, Angular, or React, which organize and structure application code.&#xD;
&#xD;
For this reason, the use of serving and realization relationships should be allowed between low-level abstraction elements of the framework that realize or support higher-level abstraction elements of the business application within the application layer. This principle should potentially be generalized across all layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Application, Domain and Infrastructure Layer are BDD/DDD terminilogy.</documentation>

  <purpose>In low-level Archimate models, deliberately detailed in terms of software architecture, I have often been confronted with the difficulty of representing the frameworks integrated into the application solutions.&#xD;
The idea of ​​this project is to represent what I considered as a way of doing based on my experience in the matter.&#xD;
Why this questioning?&#xD;
Software framework are piece of system or application software, isn't ?&#xD;
When they are used exclusively in one or the other of the layers, the application layer or the technology layer, at the same level of abstraction of use, their representation with the elements of the layer considered is the solution.&#xD;
What about when they belong to one layer but are exploited by the other?&#xD;
What about when they are described at a high level of abstraction in one layer but used critically enough to ber mentionned at a lower level of abstraction in the other?&#xD;
What about when an element of the technology layer would benefit from being represented as a concept of the application layer but it does not exist in the technology layer? A data object for example?&#xD;
What about when an element of a layer realizes a significant part of an element of the same layer but of another level of abstraction? What relationship to use?&#xD;
Should software frameworks be considered as technological elements or specialized parts with elements of the application layer?</purpose>
